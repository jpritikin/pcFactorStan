#' @section Backward incompatibility:
#' The function \link{generateFactorItems} was renamed to
#'   \code{generateSingleFactorItems} (version 1.0.2) to make space for a more
#'   flexible factor model with an arbitrary number of factors and
#'   arbitrary factor-to-item loading pattern. If you don't need this
#'   flexibility, you can call the old function \link{generateSingleFactorItems}.
