#' Vertex names, if not already factors, are converted to
#' factors.  The number of thresholds per item is determined by the
#' largest absolute response value.  Missing responses are filtered
#' out.  Responses on the same pair of vertices on the same item are
#' grouped together.  Within a vertex pair and item, responses
#' are ordered from negative to positive.
