\title{Physical activity flow propensity}
\description{Paired comparisons of 87 physical activities on 16
  flow-related facets. Participants submitted two activities using free-form
  input. These activities were substitute into item templates.
  For example, the \sQuote{predict} item asked,
  \dQuote{How predictable is the action?} with response options:
  \itemize{
    \item A1 is much more predictable than A2.
    \item A1 is somewhat more predictable than A2.
    \item Both offer roughly equal predictability.
    \item A2 is somewhat more predictable than A1.
    \item A2 is much more predictable than A1.
  }
  Most items were adapted from Jackson & Eklund (2002). 
}
\format{A data.frame with one row per activity comparison and items in
  the columns. All item responses are between -2 and 2. Zero indicates
that both activities were judged equal on the trait.}
